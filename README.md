# Final-Project-on-Predicting-CO2-Emission-from-Vehicles-Using-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model
The main goal of this report is to provide insights into the relationships between engine size, cylinder count, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions, and to develop models that can accurately predict CO2 emissions in vehicles. This report is prepared as a part of course work at WM-ASDS in JU.
